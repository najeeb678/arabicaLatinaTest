        Although we are strongly committed to delivering in the timelines
        estimated in our Order confirmation or displayed on our Website or
        above, delivery timelines are estimates only. Time shall not be
        considered of the essence. Timelines start from Order confirmation.
        However, if we have not delivered your Order within 30 days of Order
        confirmation, we will provide you with a full refund. We are not
        responsible for failures to deliver for reasons outside our reasonable
        control, including where you are not available to take delivery of your
        Order or request postponement.
        <br />
        <br />
        Orders are delivered daily excluding Fridays and KSA public holidays. It
        is your duty to ensure appropriate access for deliveries, including in
        particular but without limitation on Fridays.

        All furniture orders are final and non-returnable. When your Order is
        ready for delivery, we will contact you to agree a delivery date. Once
        agreed, you will be responsible for accepting delivery and arranging
        appropriate means of access and installation on that date. It is your
        responsibility to ensure that our delivery team has access to the
        delivery address, and that sufficient space for the goods is available,
        hallways are measured and doors and lifts can grant full access.
        <br />
        <br />
        Delivery on the first floor and above requires service elevator access
        arranged by you and it is your responsibility to notify us of any
        potential problems with access to the premises, building, service
        elevators, etcâ€¦ and make any related delivery arrangements. Where
        delivery is complicated by such factors, additional charges may apply.
        If delivery is not accepted on the agreed delivery date, goods shall be
        kept in storage free of charge for a period of up to thirty (30) days.
        If you fail to agree a revised delivery date falling within thirty (30)
        days of the initial delivery date, we retain the right to cancel your
        Order, retain all monies paid and resell the goods with no further
        liability.
        <br />
        <br />
        If on the delivery date our delivery team is unable to obtain access to
        the delivery address, a reasonable re-delivery charge may be applied. We
        will pre-inform you of this charge. In the absence of negligence, we
        will not be liable for loss or damage to the goods or your property,
        including where caused by: (i) us following your specific instructions;
        (ii) limited or no access to your nominated premises; and/or (iii) goods
        not fitting into your property. Any request to hang, erect or build
        items shall be at our discretion and we will not be responsible for any
        damage to your home in connection with such hanging, erection or
        building, nor for the integrity of such hanging, erection or building.
        Additional charges for such services may apply.
